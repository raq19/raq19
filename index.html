         <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>

        <ul>
        1<h3>Verse 1:<br></h3>
        Sorry I never told you all I wanted to say...
        And now it's too late to hold you<br>Cause you've flown away so faraway ay-ay-ay-ay
        Never had I imagined your living without your smile...<br>
        Feeling knowing you hear me it keeps me alive alive...
        <br>
   
		
		
				
		<h3><br>Chorus:</br></h3>
		And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
		Like so many friends we've lost along the way
		And I know eventually we'll be together<br>Together
		One sweet day...
		Loving you always and I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven
		Darlin' I never showed you
		(I never showed you)<br>Assumed you'd always be there (always be there)
		I thought you'd always be there
		And I... I... I take
		(Taken for granted) your presence for granted
		But I always cared<br><br>
		But I always cared
		And I miss the love we shared
		And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
		Like so many friends we've lost along the way
		(Lost along the way)
		And I know eventually
		(I know I know) we'll be together
		We'll be together
		One sweet day...<br>And all that I know is I'll wait
		(W-h-o-a...) patiently to see you in heaven.
	
		
		
		<h3><br>Verse 2:</br></h3>
		<br>Although the sun will never shine the same I'll always look to a brighter day...
		<br>Y-e-a-h... yeah Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
		You will always listen as I pray...
		And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
		Like so many (like so many) friends we've lost along the way<br>
	
	
		
		<h3><br>Chorus:</br></h3>
		<br>And I know (yes I know) eventually (I know) we'll be together
		Together
		(Y-e-a-h...) One sweet day
		(One sweet day one sweet day)
		Oh, yeah...
		And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
		I'll see you eventually
		Like so many friends we've lost along the way
		I know you're lookin' down from heaven
		And I know... I... know eventually we'll be together
		(Ooh-ooh) Yes we will
		One sweet day...
		One sweet d-a-y...
		Patiently to see you in heaven
		Sorry I never told you (ooh-ooh)
		All I wanted to say...<br>
